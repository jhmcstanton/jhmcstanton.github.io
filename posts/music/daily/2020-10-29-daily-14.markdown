title: "Daily 14: Longer tune"
---

A goofy tune written today after seeing a few of the pups chewing on snack bones and singing a few lines
to them. First time actually writing lyrics (and to a melody), so this was a fun little exercise.

The lyrics are awkward and the harmony is super simple and off in some spaces, but meh. Had a fun
time putting something down on paper.
