title: "Daily 25: Riff in E Phyrgian"
---

Had an idea this morning for some riffs so wrote them out. This is written right in the middle of the
treble clef but should be transposed down for a downtuned guitar. The rhythm is a little off from what
is intended, so that should be played with as well.


Hopefully I will come back to this to make a longer piece.
