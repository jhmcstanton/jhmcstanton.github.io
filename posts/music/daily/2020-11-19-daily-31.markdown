title: "Daily 31: Horizontal Harmony"
---

The goal with this piece was to just play with some harmonic ideas. To that end
the melody is simple and static throughout, just following the chord
progression. This starts with a I-IV-I-V progression in the key of G major to
attempt to root the listener into that key then on subsequent repetitions
of the melodies it starts to introduce new chords to point the listener forward
using fifth of fifths (V/V). In the piece the chords are labelled with their
respective roman numerals to ease following it.

I think this sounds pretty interesting and would definitely like to explore these
ideas more.
