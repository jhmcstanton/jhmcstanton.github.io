title: "Daily 22: Something in D Dorian"
---

Not as flashy as yesterday, just trying to mess with a Dorian sound. Still working out what the various
modes generally sound like and how to work with them.


The resolution falls apart on this one, but didn't think it was a great use of time to try
cleaning it up any more.
