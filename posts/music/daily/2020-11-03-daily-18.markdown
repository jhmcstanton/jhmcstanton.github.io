This is loosely based on something I was messing with on my guitar the other day.

This post also serves as a reason to create a helper script to embed ABC notation into
a page and render it with midi controls. An alternative to the script I wrote would
be to just use the [abcjs plugin](https://www.abcjs.net/abcjs-plugin.html) that renders
all abc on a page that it finds.

<details>
<summary>
<div id="paper">

<div id="audio"></div>
</summary>
<p>Click anywhere on the score to see the ABC notation of this and even edit it yourself.</p>
