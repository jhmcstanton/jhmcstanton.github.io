title: "Daily 12: A few things"

Had a hard time sleeping early this morning so put a couple of these together, then added a third one a bit later.

This first is a little melody in G Major, based around some ideas taken from a Coursera class around repetition.

This second one is playing around with harmonizing a chord in the melody using 7ths, 9ths, 11ths, etc.

<button onclick="MIDIjs.play('./daily-12-c.mid')">Play</button>
<button onclick="MIDIjs.stop()">Stop</button>

This is just playing with the Harmonic Minor. When playing around on guitar the harmonic minor with its
various half-steps between scale degrees sounds mysterious and interesting. Not sure that this was pulled
off here by strictly writing it out, but a fun exercise nonetheless.
