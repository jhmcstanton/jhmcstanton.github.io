title: "Daily 27: F Minor Melody"
---

This in the melody for today. It is in F minor and works in little melodic minor on occasion.

Side note, also checked out the `\modalTranpose` function of lilypond for shifting a motif
around a scale, which is pretty handy.
[Check out the docs if you are curious](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/changing-multiple-pitches)
