title: "Daily 26: Dorian Melodies"

Today I'm posting two melodies. Both are in D Dorian and 9/8 time.

This first one plays around with the beats in 9/8 and is kind of fun.

This second one is almost exclusively playing with arpeggios to sus out the beats and
cadence. It does play with some quartal arpeggios which are a little interesting.
