title: Interval Practice
---

Just a little practice quiz to help remind myself the various number of half steps in each interval between unison and the full octave. If you
search around a little you'll find there are other quizzes that test the user with a staff and/or audible intervals which are probably more
helpful. This is meant for the simpler case of just memorizing the definition of each interval.
