        <p><a href="https://github.com/jhmcstanton/Binder"><code>Binder</code></a> is a tool I made during my senior year at KU for taking notes in class. The intention was to make note taking on my Linux machine easy with the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to organize notes in any manner.</li>
<li>Notes should be a flat file format for ease of use, editing, and version control if desired.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúbinder‚Äù should be a single file that is easily navigable.</li>
<li>The ‚Äúbinder‚Äù should be customizable by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Binder</code> supports the above by compiling markdown files using <a href="https://pandoc.org/"><code>Pandoc</code></a> from the current working directory, and all child directories, into a single html file. This file has default styles, but can be updated by the user.</p>
<p>Beyond just wanting to build a note taking application for myself, another reason to build this tool was to become more comfortable with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_transformer">Monad transfomers</a>. In particular, <code>Binder</code> makes use of the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers"><code>transformers</code></a> and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl"><code>mtl</code></a> Haskell packages.</p>
<p>If I were to go back and refactor <code>Binder</code> my main goal would be to rely less on concrete implementation from <code>transformers</code> and more on the <code>mtl</code>-style typeclasses to keep methods generic and ready for future refactors.</p>
