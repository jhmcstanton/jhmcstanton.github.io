title: 'Rudder: The Concourse CI Pipeline DSL'
---

Announcing [`Rudder`](https://github.com/jhmcstanton/rudder), a domain specific language
for building [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) pipelines in Ruby.

## Motivation

At work we use Concourse for automating infrastructure and platform operations. The building
blocks lead to clear workflows and are easily extendable. The only complaint that I have with
it is the lack of abstraction. Many of our pipelines define the same resources, tasks, or, in
some cases, entire pipeline segments. This is a limitation in defining pipelines in single
yaml files - the only 'code' reuse are yaml anchors, which have many shortcomings and can't
be reused in other files. We have done some templating, but that is mostly helpful for
code reuse in a single file.

That's where `rudder` comes in. `rudder` allows users to define Concourse pipelines using
the full power of the host langage, ruby. The main primitives Concourse exposes match
the concourse primitives, along with the powerful entrypoint `Pipeline` that
can import any `rudder` primitive or pipeline to include in its own definition.

## Gem

The first version of `rudder` was published today to [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/rudder).
I'd love to receive some feedback from other Concourse users and Ruby developers.
