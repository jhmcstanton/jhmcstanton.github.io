title: Introducing stacker
---

In the last few months I have been on many video meetings that use the "stack"
method of facilitating speaking order. For those unfamiliar, the idea is that
attendees of the meeting write the word "stack" into the call chat box to
indicate they would like to speak. Anyone can stack at any time and speaking
order is simply first come first serve. This just helps to reduce people
speaking over each other or taking over the meeting.

The stack method works well, but it does put some extra work on the meeting
facilitator to track the stacks in chat, which can be difficult in active chats
or large meetings. Additionally, stack does not nest well. By that, I mean that
if someone wants to stack to respond to a current speaker, and not just to speak
to the general topic, extra work has to be handled by the facilitator to track
that.

This is where [`stacker`](https://github.com/jhmcstanton/stacker/) comes in.
`stacker` is a simple webapp that allows users of a call to join a new room and
stack as a direct reply to the current, short-term discussion (think of it as a
reply stack), or stack onto the traditional stack.

`stacker` is hosted on [heroku right now and welcome for anyone to
use](https://chat-stacker.herokuapp.com/)! I would love to get feedback from
folks using this in their meetings.
