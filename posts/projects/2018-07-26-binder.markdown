title: 'Binder: Another Note Taking Tool' 
---

[`Binder`](https://github.com/jhmcstanton/Binder) is a tool I made during my senior year at KU for taking notes in class. The intention was to make note taking on my Linux machine easy with the following goals:

- Allow the user to organize notes in any manner.
- Notes should be a flat file format for ease of use, editing, and version control if desired. 
- The "binder" should be a single file that is easily navigable.
- The "binder" should be customizable by the user.


`Binder` supports the above by compiling markdown files using [`Pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/) from the current working directory, and all child directories, into a single html file. This file has default styles, but can be updated by the user.

Beyond just wanting to build a note taking application for myself, another reason to build this tool was to become more comfortable with [Monad transfomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_transformer). In particular, `Binder` makes use of the [`transformers`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers) and [`mtl`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl) Haskell packages. 

If I were to go back and refactor `Binder` my main goal would be to rely less on concrete implementation from `transformers` and more on the `mtl`-style typeclasses to keep methods generic and ready for future refactors.
