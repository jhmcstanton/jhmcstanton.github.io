Recreating a recipe
[from last year](./2019-02-17-thanksgiving-winter-warmer.html) for an annual
tradition with a few friends. This time around the recipe will be largely
the same, but with a few water tweaks. Previously this was made with reverse
osmosis water without any additions. This year will use local water since
it emphasizes the malts with a few small additions.

The yeast is also being changed to a rehydrated SafAle S-04, mostly because
I've heard a lot of good things about it.
