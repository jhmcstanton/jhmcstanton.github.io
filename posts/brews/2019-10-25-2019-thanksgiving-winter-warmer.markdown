Recreating a recipe
[from last year](./2019-02-17-thanksgiving-winter-warmer.html) for an annual
tradition with a few friends. This time around the recipe will be largely
the same, but with a few water tweaks. Previously this was made with reverse
osmosis water without any additions. This year will use local water since
it emphasizes the malts with a few small additions.

The yeast is also being changed to a rehydrated SafAle S-04, mostly because
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

## Mash

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.25 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.39 |
| Target Mash Temp | 154&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 68&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 166&deg;F |
| Actual Mash Temp | 154&deg;F |

### Strike Water Profile

$partial("templates/posts/brews/water-profile.html")$

The strike water used for this infusion is the local water with some added
calcium carbonate and gypsum. Previously I used untreated RO water
for this recipe, this time around I'm trying to specifically target some baked
good flavors, and the local water lends itself to those characteristics.

## Boil

This is another pretty typical boil - one hour boil with a 15 minute addition
of spices at flameout.

### Boil Schedule

| Boil Time | Amount            | Type          |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 60 Min    | &frac13; oz (All) | Challenger    |
| 10 Min    | &frac13; oz (All) | Kent Goldings |
| 5 min     | &frac12; tab      | Whirlflocc    |
| 0 min     | All               | Spices        |

## Fermentation

This was fermented at between 63-67&deg;F. The yeast was rehydrated in
4oz of water for 30 minutes and pitched in the wort at ~74&deg;F to encourage
a vigarous start.

Turns out that my dining room is just a little too warm for my target
fermentation temperature. Instead I'm using my garage with a ferm wrap and a
blanket to hit my desired temperature. On the left in the sheet is the
[McAbod Crane](./2019-10-25-mcabod-crane.html).

## Carbonation (In Progress)

This is being carbonated in the garage between 40&deg;F - 50&deg;F at 45 PSI
for now. I also added two cinnamon sticks sanitized in Fire and Cane
Glenfiddich.

## Things to do Better

This time around my OG and attenuation were both lower than I would have liked
I believe that the OG was caused by a last minute decision to mash at
154&deg;F, which was probably waaay higher than it should have been. The
attenuation issues may have been caused by not using a yeast starter. This brew
was only 3 gallons, but the high gravity was seemingly too much for the single
rehydrated packet.
