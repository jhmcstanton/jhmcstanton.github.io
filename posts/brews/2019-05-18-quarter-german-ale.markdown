title: (Fermentation-in-Progress) I'm a &frac14; German Ale
---

I'm looking to make several simple beers this summer that can appeal
to more than just craft beer drinkers, so this time around I'm making
a super simple [SMaSH](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/keeping-it-simple-with-smash-brewing/) blonde ale. This one is just
American 2-row malted barley, a little Carapils for body, and leftover
Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h hops from a cream ale recipe last summer, so it's
just a _little_ Bavarian. 

## Recipe: I'm a &frac14; German Ale

| Actual OG | 58 |
| Expected FG | 14 |
| Actual FG | Fermentation-in-Progress |
| ABV | TBD |
| IBU | 18 |
| Mash | Single Infusion, 60 min |
| Boil | 60 min |

### Ingredients

Ingredients are per 1 gallon where applicable

| Amount | Ingredient |
|-|-|
| _Fermentables_ | |
| 2.33 lb | American 2-row Malt |
| 0.123 lb | Carapils |
| | |
| _Hops_ | |
| 1 oz | Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h 3%\* AA |
| | |
| _Yeast_ | |
| 1 packet\*\* |  White Labs WLP 060 American Ale Yeast | 
| | |
| _Other_ | |
| 1/2 tab\*\* | Whirlfloc | 

\* I used [this calculator](https://brewerslog.appspot.com/HopAlphaCalc)
to estimate the remaining alpha acid content of my leftover hops. 

\*\* Note that this should be enough for up to 5 gal.

## Mash

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.5 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.38 |
| Target Mash Temp | 150&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 70&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 161&deg;F |
| Actual Mash Temp | 149&deg;F |
| Strike Water Volume | 2.76&deg;F |
| Sparge Water volume | 2.75&deg;F |
| | |
| (Strike) Water Treatment | per 1 gal |
| Calcium Chloride | 3 g |
| Gypsum | 1 g |

### Strike Water Additions

All water for this recipe is Reverse Osmosis (RO) water. To add back in 
the necessary minerals

  <img src="/images/posts/brews/2019-05-18-quarter-german/water-treatment.jpg" >
</div>

The additions are based on an estimated pH of 6.0 for the RO water. This
was decided because, although RO is close to pure water and should be near
7.0, once exposed to air it can drop to 5.5 or 5.0. I went ahead and
double checked the water before adding the minerals, and it looked to be
about where estimated.

The first batch produced almost half the needed wort for the boil. A few cup fulls (probably several liters) of the first runnings went back in to clarify, although I don't know that it cleared it up _that_ much.
I am a little curious if lowering the water-to-grist ratio to 1.25 from 
1.5 would help clarify the beer - I've noticed a large amount of loose
grain in the mash tun that doesn't contributed to filtering the beer.

The sparge water was poured and the grain bed allowed to settle for 20 
minutes before continuing the sparge.

The gravity at this point is 1.043.

## Boil 

### Boil Schedule

| Time Remaining in Boil | Addition |
|-|-|
| 60 min | 0.75 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h |
| 20 min | 0.1 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h | 
| 10 min | 0.15 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h |
| 5 min | Whirlflocc |

## Fermentation

This is being fermented in a basement that is typically in the low 60&deg;s F (it was 63&deg;F today). The carboy is wrapped in a fermwrap and
temperate controlled with an Inkbird controller, set to the range of 68-72 &deg;F.

Unfortunately I forgot to add my typical yeast nutrient and energizer to 
this batch, but its probably fine since its a small one.

# Things to do Better

## Efficiency

The only real process change today was stirring every 15 minutes during
the mash. This actually seemed to help quite a bit. The grain was 
purchased and milled at the same home brew store as [my previous brew](/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2.html),
and the efficiency looks to be about 65%, which is more in line with
what I typically expect. I would be very curious to find out what the 
efficiency would be when brewing with grains from a store that I've had
better experiences with as well.

## Clarity

As mentioned in [mash](#mash) above, I've been using a rather high 
water-to-grist ratio of 1.5 quarts per pound of grain. A more typical
number would be 1.25 quarts/pound, and I'd be curious if this would help
with clarity at all.
