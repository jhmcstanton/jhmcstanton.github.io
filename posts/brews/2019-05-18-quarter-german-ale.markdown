I'm looking to make several simple beers this summer that can appeal
to more than just craft beer drinkers, so this time around I'm making
a super simple [SMaSH](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/keeping-it-simple-with-smash-brewing/) blonde ale. This one is just
American 2-row malted barley, a little Carapils for body, and leftover
Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h hops from a cream ale recipe last summer, so it's
just a _little_ Bavarian. 

## Recipe: I'm a &frac14; German Ale

### Ingredients

Ingredients are per 1 gallon where applicable

| Amount | Ingredient |
|-|-|
| _Fermentables_ | |
| 2.33 lb | American 2-row Malt |

to estimate the remaining alpha acid content of my leftover hops. 

\*\* Note that this should be enough for up to 5 gal.

## Mash

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.5 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.38 |
| Target Mash Temp | 150&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 70&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 161&deg;F |
| Actual Mash Temp | 149&deg;F |
| Strike Water Volume | 2.76&deg;F |
| Sparge Water volume | 2.75&deg;F |
| | |
| (Strike) Water Treatment | per 1 gal |
| Calcium Chloride | 3 g |
| Gypsum | 1 g |

### Strike Water Additions

All water for this recipe is Reverse Osmosis (RO) water. To add back in 
the necessary minerals 

$partial("templates/posts/brews/water-profile.html")$

  <img src="/images/posts/brews/2019-05-18-quarter-german/water-treatment.jpg" >
</div>

The additions are based on an estimated pH of 6.0 for the RO water. This
was decided because, although RO is close to pure water and should be near
7.0, once exposed to air it can drop to 5.5 or 5.0. I went ahead and
double checked the water before adding the minerals, and it looked to be
about where estimated.

The first batch produced almost half the needed wort for the boil. A few cup fulls (probably several liters) of the first runnings went back in to clarify, although I don't know that it cleared it up _that_ much.
I am a little curious if lowering the water-to-grist ratio to 1.25 from 
1.5 would help clarify the beer - I've noticed a large amount of loose
grain in the mash tun that doesn't contributed to filtering the beer.

The sparge water was poured and the grain bed allowed to settle for 20 
minutes before continuing the sparge.

The gravity at this point is 1.043.

## Boil 

### Boil Schedule

| Time Remaining in Boil | Addition |
|-|-|
| 60 min | 0.75 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h |
| 20 min | 0.1 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h | 
| 10 min | 0.15 oz Hallertau Mittelfr&#252;h |
| 5 min | Whirlflocc |

## Fermentation

This is being fermented in a basement that is typically in the low 60&deg;s F (it was 63&deg;F today). The carboy is wrapped in a fermwrap and
temperate controlled with an Inkbird controller, set to the range of 68-72 &deg;F.

</div>

Unfortunately I forgot to add my typical yeast nutrient and energizer to 
this batch, but its probably fine since its a small one.

The wort was allowed to sit in the primary for 16 days, mostly because
there wasn't a free keg available. The yeast did a bit more work than
anticipated on this guy, ending up with an FG 4 points lower than
expected (about an extra 0.4% ABV).

## Kegging and Carbonation

This was force carbonated
in a basement sitting around ~63&deg;F at 30 PSI for 3 days. This was 
_extra_ force carbonated with the rolling technique for ~3 minutes 
at 30 PSI to ensure it's carbed within a week.

# Result

## Taste Test 1

This taste test was taken on 6/6/19, 3 days after force carbing the beer.
The beer was 64&deg;F.

### Appearance

This one was definitely blonde and _very_ hazy. It could use a cold crash
for clarity. The head appeared light and fluffy, and then dissipated 
quickly.

### Aroma

Very mild. Herbal with a medicinal hint at the end, although not an unpleasant one.

### Taste

Pleasant and mild, up front there is earth and herb - the hops are running
the show. This is followed by cracker with a bolder herbal finish.

### Mouthfeel

Light-end of medium. Surprisingly dry finish. 

## Taste Test 2

This test was on 6/7/19 after cooling the beer for 13 hours to 43&deg;F.

<img src="/images/posts/brews/2019-05-18-quarter-german/beer_2.jpg" class="brew-photo">

### Appearance

Pretty much the same, although without the head. I depressurized the keg
a bit too much trying to fix the giant head I had in the first taste test.

### Aroma

A little maltier. Still herbal, but not medicinal at all this time.

### Taste

Earthy and herbal again. A little cracker as well, but a bit sweeter.

### Mouthfeel

Light-end of medium again. Dry, although not all in the finish.


## Clarity Test 3

This test was on 6/14/19 after letting the beer crash for 48 hours at
43&deg;F and then slowly brought back to room temperature since I
typically don't continuously refill my coolers with ice.

</div>

The cold crash cleared this right up. I haven't had that much luck with
crashing before (not that I've done it often), but this turned out
better than expected.

So, clear, still blonde, with a soft white head that recedes quickly.

# Things to do Better

## Efficiency

The only real process change today was stirring every 15 minutes during
the mash. This actually seemed to help quite a bit. The grain was 
purchased and milled at the same home brew store as [my previous brew](/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2.html),
and the efficiency looks to be about 65%, which is more in line with
what I typically expect. I would be very curious to find out what the 
efficiency would be when brewing with grains from a store that I've had
better experiences with as well.

## Clarity

As mentioned in [mash](#mash) above, I've been using a rather high 
water-to-grist ratio of 1.5 quarts per pound of grain. A more typical
number would be 1.25 quarts/pound, and I'd be curious if this would help
with clarity at all.

### Update

Wow, the cold crash did wonders on this beer. I still plan on playing
with some other things, but will be planning on cold crashing my beers
in the future whenever possible.
