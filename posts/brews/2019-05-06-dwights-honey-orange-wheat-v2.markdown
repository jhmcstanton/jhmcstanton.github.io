title: (Carbonation-in-Progress) Dwight's Honey Orange Wheat v2
---

Well, its summer time again and about time to brew a crowd pleaser from last year, [Dwight's Honey Orange Wheat](/posts/brews/2018-08-01-dwights-orange-honey-wheat.html). Last year this was an extract recipe that we tweaked a little to more closely follow Palmer's extract brewing method and added an addition of orange peel for some orange aromas. Since then I've [built a mash tun](/posts/brews/2018-10-10-lets-build-a-mash-tun.html) and started brewing all-grain recipes exclusively, so, naturally, I converted this extract recipe to all-grain as well. 

In addition to changing to all grain we made several ingredient upgrades. First, the honey changed from basic clover honey to orange blossom honey. I have never seen orange blossom honey in stores near my house before, but I have tried mead made with it and the orange is very obvious. The consistency of the particular brand of orange blossom honey I tried is also much runnier than clover honey and a lot easier to work with. 

We also upgraded our yeast from simple [Muntons Ale Yeast](https://www.muntonshomebrew.com/category/yeasts-and-other-products/) to a White Labs [WLP-029 K&ouml;lcsh ale yeast](https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp029-german-ale-k-lsch-yeast). This should provide a crisp, clean tasting beer.

### Strike Water Additions 

This brew still used Reverse Osmosis (RO) water, and the strike water was treated with table salt and calcium chloride to hit the target pH.

Super weird looking! Not sure exactly why this had so little color, possibly just the small size of the grain bill. Will probably dig into this later.

I also didn't think to run the first runnings back through the grain bed to clear it up, not sure that it mattered this time though.

At this point the gravity was a measly 24 points.

## Boil

We did notice a little color come into the beer after adding the honey, although it is still pretty odd looking right now.

## Fermentation

The carboy was kept in the basement which typically hovers in the low 60&deg;s and wrapped in a fermwrap targeting 70&deg;-72&deg;F.

</div>

The primary fermentation was most active in the first 3 days, and a total
of 8 days was allowed for the primary. The yeast did a lot more work than
expected, with the FG landing between 7 and 8 points. 

## Carbing

The beer has been racked to a keg and allowed to carb for ~2 weeks at 60&deg;F / 30 psi. Unfortunately I don't have anywhere cooler to carb this until Memorial Day, hence the high psi. 

# Things To Do Better

This is still fermenting, but there is already stuff to look into for next time. The main one so far is simply brewhouse efficiency, but will be adding some more notes in the next few weeks.

## Efficiency

Typically I assume an efficiency of 60-65%, depending on how optimistic I'm feeling. I haven't done much yet to try to raise this, so far just including water treatment in the brew homework. However, water treatment wasn't sufficient this time - the efficiency is much closer to a shockingly low 50%. 

One suggestion that was made to me months ago was that the grain I'm using isn't milled well enough. This could be because some homebrew shops don't mill very finely or don't tighten up their mills often, or any number of reasons somewhat outside my control since I dont personally mill the grain. Unfortunately, I haven't consistently sourced my grain from the same place, so this is difficult to account for when planning a recipe. One more piece of equipment to purchase would simply be a grain mill to keep at home and set as needed, rather than relying on whatever brew shop the grain is coming from.

Secondly, I've read that stirring for a few seconds every 15 minutes has helped some batch sparging brewers. Given that most of us avoid opening the mash tun to maintain the temperature this is pretty surprising, but since this is cheap solution I'll be giving this a shot next time.
