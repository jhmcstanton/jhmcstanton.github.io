    <section>
        <p>Well, its summer time again and about time to brew a crowd pleaser from last year, <a href="../../posts/brews/2018-08-01-dwights-orange-honey-wheat.html">Dwight‚Äôs Honey Orange Wheat</a>. Last year this was an extract recipe that we tweaked a little to more closely follow Palmer‚Äôs extract brewing method and added an addition of orange peel for some orange aromas. Since then I‚Äôve <a href="../../posts/brews/2018-10-10-lets-build-a-mash-tun.html">built a mash tun</a> and started brewing all-grain recipes exclusively, so, naturally, I converted this extract recipe to all-grain as well.</p>
<p>In addition to changing to all grain we made several ingredient upgrades. First, the honey changed from basic clover honey to orange blossom honey. I have never seen orange blossom honey in stores near my house before, but I have tried mead made with it and the orange is very obvious. The consistency of the particular brand of orange blossom honey I tried is also much runnier than clover honey and a lot easier to work with.</p>
<p>We also upgraded our yeast from simple <a href="https://www.muntonshomebrew.com/category/yeasts-and-other-products/">Muntons Ale Yeast</a> to a White Labs <a href="https://www.whitelabs.com/yeast-bank/wlp029-german-ale-k-lsch-yeast">WLP-029 K√∂lcsh ale yeast</a>. This should provide a crisp, clean tasting beer.</p>

<p>Super weird looking! Not sure exactly why this had so little color, possibly just the small size of the grain bill. Will probably dig into this later.</p>
<p>I also didn‚Äôt think to run the first runnings back through the grain bed to clear it up, not sure that it mattered this time though.</p>
<p>At this point the gravity was a measly 24 points.</p>

<p>We did notice a little color come into the beer after adding the honey, although it is still pretty odd looking right now.</p>
<h2 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h2>
<p>The carboy was kept in the basement which typically hovers in the low 60¬∞s and wrapped in a fermwrap targeting 70¬∞-72¬∞F.</p>
<div class="grid-container">
<p><img alt="fermentation_1" src="../../images/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2/fermentation_1.jpg"> <img alt="fermentation_2" src="../../images/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2/fermentation_2.jpg"> <img alt="fermentation_3" src="../../images/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2/fermentation_3.jpg"></p>
</div>
<p>The primary fermentation was most active in the first 3 days, and a total of 8 days was allowed for the primary. The yeast did a lot more work than expected, with the FG landing between 7 and 8 points.</p>
<h2 id="carbing">Carbing</h2>
<p>The beer has been racked to a keg and allowed to carb for ~2 weeks at 60¬∞F and 30 psi. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have anywhere cooler to carb this until Memorial Day, hence the high psi.</p>
<h1 id="result">Result</h1>
<h2 id="taste-test-1">Taste Test 1</h2>
<p>This taste taste was taken on 5/30/19, due to a few things popping up. The beer was served at ~63¬∞F.</p>
<p><img alt="beer_1" src="../../images/posts/brews/2019-05-06-dwights-honey-orange-wheat-v2/beer_1.jpg" class="brew-photo"></p>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<p>This wheater turned out a straw color with obvious haze. The head is thick with a dense, creamy appearance, and chased the brew down the glass.</p>
<h3 id="aroma">Aroma</h3>
<p>Honey. Very clear honey, just like when pouring honey from the bottle. Very floral with a hint of vanilla. Upon closer inspection orange appears. No malt or hops.</p>
<h3 id="flavor">Flavor</h3>
<p>Honey right up front, crashing onto the palate. Again, floral and a little grassy. The honey makes way for fresh yeast bread once swirled. The finish pulls in a little sweet orange on the way down.</p>
<h3 id="mouthfeel">Mouthfeel</h3>
<p>Low to medium body, crisp. Rolls and slides around the tongue easily with a melted cream feel.</p>
<h2 id="taste-tests-2-and-3">Taste Tests 2 and 3</h2>
<p>These taste tests were on 5/31/19 and 6/1/19. The keg was chilled in a cooler over night to the upper 30¬∞Fs - low 40¬∞Fs.</p>
<h3 id="aroma-1">Aroma</h3>
<p>At these temperatures the honey aromas all disappear. A light malt and bread crust smell comes out along with a <em>tiny</em> hint of orange.</p>
<h3 id="taste">Taste</h3>
<p>As one would expect, the honey flavors all slipped away. Here the bread flavors are most prevalent with a hint of orange peel at the tail end. One sampler noticed some strawberry as well.</p>
<h1 id="things-to-do-better">Things To Do Better</h1>
<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>
<p>Typically I assume an efficiency of 60-65%, depending on how optimistic I‚Äôm feeling. I haven‚Äôt done much yet to try to raise this, so far just including water treatment in the brew homework. However, water treatment wasn‚Äôt sufficient this time - the efficiency is much closer to a shockingly low 50%.</p>
<p>One suggestion that was made to me months ago was that the grain I‚Äôm using isn‚Äôt milled well enough. This could be because some homebrew shops don‚Äôt mill very finely or don‚Äôt tighten up their mills often, or any number of reasons somewhat outside my control since I dont personally mill the grain. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt consistently sourced my grain from the same place, so this is difficult to account for when planning a recipe. One more piece of equipment to purchase would simply be a grain mill to keep at home and set as needed, rather than relying on whatever brew shop the grain is coming from.</p>
<p>Secondly, I‚Äôve read that stirring for a few seconds every 15 minutes has helped some batch sparging brewers. Given that most of us avoid opening the mash tun to maintain the temperature this is pretty surprising, but since this is cheap solution I‚Äôll be giving this a shot next time.</p>
<h2 id="serving-temperature-control">Serving Temperature Control</h2>
<p>Kegging is great. Such a simple way to carbonate an entire batch of beer that doesn‚Äôt involve cleaning 30 to 50 bottles. However, in my case maintaining a proper serving temperature is difficult since I don‚Äôt have a keezer of any sort, instead I fill a cooler with ice and just drop the temperature somewhat haphazardly. At some point down the road having a keezer would be great just to maintain a more specific ball park temperature. In this beer‚Äôs case I would have loved to serve it from 48¬∞F to 54¬∞F, but served it on either side of that range.</p>
<h2 id="honey-additions">Honey Additions</h2>
<p>This time around we decided to not change anything in the boil process since we were already making drastic changes converting the beer to all grain from extract. The honey was added during the boil, but both of us brewing were both strongly leaning towards adding the honey either after the boil or after the primary to attempt to maximize the honey flavor and aroma. The next time we brew this, hopefully later this summer, we plan on moving back the honey addition to one of those times.</p>
<h2 id="just-chill">Just Chill</h2>
<p>After we mashed the grain we were pretty put off by the color, or lack thereof, of the wort. There was a fair amount of second guessing and concerns that we made a mistake or skipped a step somewhere. Oddly enough with the original extract version of this recipe we had a similar concern - after fermenting but before bottle conditioning the uncarbonated beer tasted <em>pretty awful</em>. However, in both cases the beer turned out to be a pretty great crowd pleaser. It‚Äôs easy to second guess a brew or over think it, but we need to just remember it‚Äôs still going to be beer and it will probably be <em>pretty ok</em>.</p>
