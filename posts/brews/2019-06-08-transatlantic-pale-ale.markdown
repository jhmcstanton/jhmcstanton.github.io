Taking a crack at a British pale ale to get a handle on maris otter.
May also be brewing this to use up some fridge hops.

## Recipe: Transatlantic Pale Ale

Calling this _Transatlantic Pale Ale_ since it is utilizing East Kent 
Goldings from the east side and Chinook from the West.

| 1.6 lb         | Maris Otter               |

| _Hops_         |                                |
| 0.2 oz         | East Kent Goldings 3.9% AA     |
| 0.1 oz         | Chinook 10.8 % AA\*\*           |
| 0.1 oz        | Chinook 12.4 % AA\*\*           |
|                |                                |
| _Yeast_        |                                |
| 1 packet\*     | Omega OYL-016 British Ale VIII |

|                | Yeast Energizer                |
|                |                                |

| 1/2 tab\*      | Whirlflocc                     |

\* Note that this should be enough for up to 5 gal.
\*\* The 10.8% AA were hops I already had available, but some extra
was needed, hence the inclusion of the 12.4% AA.

## Mash 

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.25 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.4  |
| Target Mash Temp | 152&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 70&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 163&deg;F |
| Actual Mash Temp | TBD       |
| Strike Water Volume (1 gallon batch) | 0.71 gal |
| Sparge Water volume (1 gallon batch)  | 1.14 gal |

### Strike Water Profile

This and [the summer saison](2019-06-08-summer-saison.html) will be
my first attempts to use local water. There is little calcium from the tap
so I'll be using calcium chloride to add it in, as well as 10% phosphoric
acid to drop the pH to the target.

Just highlighting the clarity gains from running the wort back through
the grain bed. I probably ran a few gallons back through, and managed
to get a fair amount filtered out.

## Boil

### Boil Schedule

Values are for 1 gallon batch.

| Time Remaining in Boil | Addition                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 60 min                 | 0.1 oz Chinook 10.8% AA   |
|                        | 0.04 oz Chinook 12.4% AA  |
| 20 min                 | 0.06 oz Chinook 12.4% AA  |
| 10 min                 | 0.1 oz East Kent Goldings |
| 5 min                  | 1/2 tab Whirlfloc\*  |
| Flameout               | 0.1 oz East Kent Goldings |

\* Should be sufficient for up to 5 gallons.

## Fermentation

This wort is being fermented in the basement, typically hovering
around 64&deg;F, with a fermwrap. The fermentation range is 
67-71&deg;F to try to get some fruit flavor out of the yeast.

On last check, about 14 hours after pitching, no noticeable activity had
started.
