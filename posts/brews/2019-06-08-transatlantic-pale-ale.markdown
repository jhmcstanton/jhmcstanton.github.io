Taking a crack at a British pale ale to get a handle on maris otter.
May also be brewing this to use up some fridge hops.

## Recipe: Transatlantic Pale Ale

Calling this _Transatlantic Pale Ale_ since it is utilizing East Kent 
Goldings from the east side and Chinook from the West.

|----------------|--------------------------------|
| _Fermentables_ |                                |
| 1.6 lb         | Maris Otter               |
| 0.7 lb         | Crystal Malt 40&deg; L    |
|                |                                |
| _Hops_         |                                |
| 0.2 oz         | East Kent Goldings 3.9% AA     |
| 0.1 oz         | Chinook 10.8 % AA\*\*           |
| 0.1 oz        | Chinook 12.4 % AA\*\*           |
|                |                                |
| _Yeast_        |                                |
| 1 packet\*     | Omega OYL-016 British Ale VIII |
|                | Yeast Nutrient                 |
|                | Yeast Energizer                |
|                |                                |
| _Other_        |                                |
| 1/2 tab\*      | Whirlflocc                     |

\* Note that this should be enough for up to 5 gal.
\*\* The 10.8% AA were hops I already had available, but some extra
was needed, hence the inclusion of the 12.4% AA.

## Mash 

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.25 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.4  |
| Target Mash Temp | 152&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 70&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 163&deg;F |
| Actual Mash Temp | TBD       |
| Strike Water Volume (1 gallon batch) | 0.71 gal |
| Sparge Water volume (1 gallon batch)  | 1.14 gal |

### Strike Water Profile

This and [the summer saison](2019-06-08-summer-saison.html) will be
my first attempts to use local water. There is little calcium from the tap
so I'll be using calcium chloride to add it in, as well as 10% phosphoric
acid to drop the pH to the target.

Just highlighting the clarity gains from running the wort back through
the grain bed. I probably ran a few gallons back through, and managed
to get a fair amount filtered out.

## Boil

### Boil Schedule

Values are for 1 gallon batch.

| Time Remaining in Boil | Addition                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 60 min                 | 0.1 oz Chinook 10.8% AA   |
|                        | 0.04 oz Chinook 12.4% AA  |
| 20 min                 | 0.06 oz Chinook 12.4% AA  |
| 10 min                 | 0.1 oz East Kent Goldings |
| 5 min                  | 1/2 tab Whirlfloc\*  |
| Flameout               | 0.1 oz East Kent Goldings |

\* Should be sufficient for up to 5 gallons.

## Fermentation

This wort is being fermented in the basement, typically hovering
around 64&deg;F, with a fermwrap. The fermentation range is 
67-71&deg;F to try to get some fruit flavor out of the yeast.

  </figure>
</div>

Yeast activity was slow to start, with the first noticeable activity
beginning 26 - 30 hours after pitching the yeast. Fermentation was
definitely complete after 9 days.

The gravity came out a little lower than expected, but within style.

## Carbonation

This was carbonated in the keg at 64&deg;F at 22 PSI. This was
supplemented with the rolling method - carbing at 35 PSI for 3-5 minutes
while rolling the keg vigorously.

# Result

## Taste Test 1

This taste test was taken on 6/27/19, 2 days after force carbing the beer
in the keg. The keg quickly cooled in a cooler, with the beer hitting
a temperature of 47.8&deg;F. The keg had not been cooled long enough
to cold crash the beer yet.

### Appearance

Light brown, toasty head with mild retention. The liquid is an
extremely hazy red-brown.

### Aroma

Primarily toffee and some caramel.

### Taste

Toffee. A little raisin with herbal earthiness. Slight bite to the finish.

### Mouthfeel

Medium body. Slightly acidic. It could probably stand to be carbonated
a bit more.

# Things to do Better

So far, I'm pretty pleased with this beer. There are a few things I'd like
to tweak, some of which I've said in other posts.

## Efficiency

This brew the original gravity was pretty well nailed, which is great.
However, now that that is nailed I'd like to work on raising the
efficiency above 65%.

## Clarity

The clarity out of the tun is frequently problematic. This time I lowered
the water to grist ratio and added rice hulls, but the wort
was still pretty hazy and grainy (worked pretty well with the [summer
saison](./2019-06-08-summer-saison.html) though). I'll need to look
into tweaking the tun in the future.

## Water Experimentation

Just for the heck of it, I'd like to brew this, or a similar beer, with
an alternate water profile. This profile seemed to drive a strong malt
presence, and I'd be curious how much this would differ of the profile
emphasized hops more. It would also be interesting to just take a new
recipe and try a couple of water profiles on it simultaneously.
