An attempt at making a refreshing, sessionable saison for hot days
on the porch. This is utilizing malted white wheat rather than raw
to cut some of the wheat bite, just as an extra step to make this 
sharable.

## Mash 

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.25 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.23 |
| Target Mash Temp | 151&deg;F |
| Grain Temp | 70&deg;F 
| Strike Water Temp | 163&deg;F  |
| Actual Mash Temp | 150       |
| Strike Water Volume (1 gal batch) | 0.53 gal   |
| Sparge Water volume ( 1 gal batch) | 0.85 gal   |

### Strike Water Profile

This and [the transatlantic pale ale](2019-06-08-transatlantic-pale-ale.html) 
will be my first attempts to use local water. There is little 
calcium from the tap so I'll be using calcium chloride to add it in, 
as well as 10% phosphoric acid to drop the pH to the target.

Definitely pleased with the clarity after the mash.

### Mash Hiccup

The strike water didn't quite get the grain to the desired temperature
of 151&deg;F, and I didn't even have enough back upwater on hand to get
raise the temperature high enough, so this mashed at 148&deg;F for 7
minutes, then was raised to 150&deg; for the remainder of the mash.

## Boil

### Boil Schedule

Values are for 1 gallon batch.

| Time Remaining in Boil | Addition          |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| 60 min                 | 0.1 oz Tettnang   |
| 35 min               | 0.1 oz Tettnang   |
| 5 min                  | 1/2 tab Whirlfloc\* |
| Flameout         | 0.2 oz Tettnang   |

\* Should be sufficient for up to 5 gallons.

Hit the Original Gravity spot on with this one. At some point I'll need
to work on bumping my efficiency beyond 65%. 

## Fermentation

This is being kept in a room that is typically in the low 70&deg;Fs, and
occasionally the upper 60&deg;Fs. To accomodate for the slightly low
ambient temperature I'm simply wrapping the carboy with a blanket to
allow the yeast to warm itself.

Fermentation activity began within 16 hours.
