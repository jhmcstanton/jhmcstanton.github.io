An attempt at making a refreshing, sessionable saison for hot days
on the porch. This is utilizing malted white wheat rather than raw
to cut some of the wheat bite, just as an extra step to make this 
sharable.

## Mash 

| | |
|-|-|
| Type | Single Infusion |
| Sparge | Batch |
| Water/Grist | 1.25 qt/lb |
| Target pH | 5.23 |
| Target Mash Temp | 151&deg;F |

### Strike Water Additions

This and [the transatlantic pale ale](2019-06-08-transatlantic-pale-ale.html) 
will be my first attempts to use local water. There is little 
calcium from the tap so I'll be using calcium chloride to add it in, 
as well as 10% phosphoric acid to drop the pH to the target. 

## Boil
