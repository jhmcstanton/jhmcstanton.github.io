My first attempt at a pumpkin beer, this is a recipe from [Frank Clark and
Beer & Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/anatomy-of-a-colonial-era-pumpkin-ale/).
Clark is a food historian, and this recipe is what he thought might be an
example of a colonial style pumpkin beer with a few tweaks thrown in to match
more modern expectations. These didn't typically include much in the way of
spices, and pumpkin was supposedly used since barley was an expensive import item.

I'm swapping in 2-row barley for the 6 due to availability. This will result
in a slightly higher yield than the original recipe, but not significantly so.
