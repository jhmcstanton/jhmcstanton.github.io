My first attempt at a pumpkin beer, this is a recipe from [Frank Clark and
Beer & Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/anatomy-of-a-colonial-era-pumpkin-ale/).
Clark is a food historian, and this recipe is what he thought might be an
example of a colonial style pumpkin beer with a few tweaks thrown in to match
more modern expectations. These didn't typically include much in the way of
spices, and pumpkin was supposedly used since barley was an expensive import item.

I'm swapping in 2-row barley for the 6 due to availability. This will result
in a slightly higher yield than the original recipe, but not significantly so.

This is just the local water with gypsum and calcium carbonate added.

I was concerned about the pumpkin chunks clogging up the sparge, so I also
threw in rice hulls.

## Boil

A 60 minute boil with an addition of molasses at flameout.

### Boil Schedule

| Boil Time | Amount            | Type          |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 60 Min    | &frac13; oz (All) | Kent Goldings |
| 5 min     | &frac12; tab      | Whirlflocc    |
| 0 min     | &#X2152; lb (All)           | Molasses      |

This boil didn't go exactly as planned - I was wrapping up this year's
[Thanksgiving Winter Warmer](./2019-10-25-2019-thanksgiving-winter-warmer.html)
and didn't notice how much was being boiled off. Probably lost about
an extra third of a gallon - not a big deal, but this is a bit higher
gravity than intended.

## Fermentation

This was fermented at between 63-67&deg;F. The yeast was rehydrated in
4oz of water for 30 minutes and pitched in the wort at ~74&deg;F to encourage
a vigarous start. I'm not terribly concerned about temperature control on
this beer since it is intended to have some old roots - colonial brewers
didn't exactly have the benefit of tight temperature controls.

Turns out that my dining room is just a little too warm for my target
fermentation temperature. Instead I'm using my garage with a ferm wrap and a
blanket to hit my desired temperature. On the right in the sheet is the
[Thanksgiving Winter Warmer](./2019-10-25-2019-thanksgiving-winter-warmer.html).

*Kegging day update* I noticed after removing the sheet from around the carboy
on keg day that the beer had two leaves from the outdoor boil still floating
around. Just going to call it a colonial touch.

## Carbonation

Carbonation was started in the garage between 40&deg;F - 50&deg;F at 45 PSI
for several days, alternating between this keg and the 2019 Winter Warmer, until
I could be bothered setting up my freezer for carbonating. Once I got around
to that this was moved into the freezer and 
carbonated between 38&deg;F - 48&deg;F at 10 PSI until serving time (about 1
week). The C02 tank was still being alternated between this and the Winter Warmer.

## Result

<img  alt="beer" src="/images/posts/brews/2019-10-25-mcabod-crane/beer.jpg" alt="Final Result" class="brew-photo">

### Appearance

Burnt orange, hazy, and off-white, brownish head. Cleared up a bit more after
settling, and will probably clear up more while carbonating.

### Aroma

Pumpkin or squash, somewhat starchy. Has a bit of a medicinal smell.

### Flavor

Squash again. Very mild flavor and not much going on at all.

### Mouthfeel

Medium body with a bit of a slickness.

## Conclusion

This was a fun brew. It's interesting to see how beer may have been in a different
place and time, even if the recipe has been slightly updated. I'm glad I tried it
out but, realistically, this would be a one and done for me. I'd recommend to
other brewers interested in historical brews since it _is_ drinkable, but its 
not a great beer by itself.
