title: "Lukewarm Take #2: Democratize Police Procedures"
---

Lukewarm take of the day: police procedure must be democratized.
What does that mean? Any community that decides to keep (or has imposed upon it)
a police force needs to have that force brought more under the will of the
community that it polices.

## Democratically Controlled Police Departments

When we think about political involvement in our communities we tend to
think about making our voices heard via voting or city council meetings.
Discussions may revolve around new regulations but, up until the defund the
police movement, these conversations have typically identified what penalities
may be levied against a guilty party, but not enforcement. In other words, 
we talk about the ends but not the means. That may OK(ish) in some specific
circumstances (consider the IRS or similar departments), but any means that
involves police presence must be taken to the people. Any new methodology that
the department wants to use to aid its work must be aired out with the community
it would be used on.

Consider [this example in Oregon](https://aclu-or.org/en/press-releases/aclu-oregon-comment-portland-ban-facial-recognition-technology).
The Portland city council banned facial recognition technology used by the
government and corporations. This is a great example of using the voice of
the people to correct police, government, and corporations overstepping
their bounds. However, this process was inherently inverted. The organizations
that decided to use these technologies made this decision without the express
consent of the people it was inflicting with it. The police currently do not have
to get consent at all, instead the people's representatives must monitor them and
impose new restrictions at every turn to keep them in check. This is untenable.
Communities, and then their reps, have to chase down these processes while new
ones are added. We're still demanding that no-knock warrants and chokeholds
be banned, how long have those been around?

This is not limited to enforcement of laws. Look at the [banning of so-called
"warrior-style" training](https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/05/bob-kroll-minneapolis-warrior-police-training/)
in Minneapolis. Again, great first step. Again, another inversion of control
from the people. Again, lives were lost before anything changed. Surely most
jurisdictions where this type of training takes place are unaware that
"killology" is even a type of training their police can, and have, received.
Communities must have a voice in every layer of their police department.
Communities must have a choice if they even _have_ a police department.

## Conclusion

This isn't a hot take _at all._ Ideally communities will demand to have their
police defunded and disbanded entirely with enough force to make it happen. Any
community that decides to keep their existing police force _should be allowed a
voice in their process._ Police are there to maintain "law and order" but how
often is this process democratic? We vote for legislators to make laws that
reflect our community's interests, but we minimize the transparency into those
that will enforce those laws and what methods they are allowed to take in
that process. The _absolute minimum_ we should do in police reformation is
demand transparency and direct democratic control of procedures used by the
police and any third parties or contractors in the mix of policing the people.

### TL;DR

ACAB, if your community will not demand defunding the police at least demand
direct democratic control of police processes.
