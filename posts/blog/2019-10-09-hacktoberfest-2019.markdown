title: Hacktoberfest 2019!
---

Just a quick reminder that Hacktoberfest is in full swing, and there is still
time to help the awesome folks doing open source work that we benefit from
every day. Hacktoberfest registration is
[over here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), and you can view your
progress 
[on your Hacktoberfest profile](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/profile).

This year they changed up the rules a little - now you only need 4 pull requests
instead of 5. These don't need to be massive changes, projects often have low
hanging fruit that maintainers could use our help knocking out.

Happy hacking!
