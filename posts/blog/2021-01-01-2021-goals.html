        <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Every year I try to make some personal and professional goals. Last year was the first time I decided to hold myself additionally accountable by posting them <a href="./2020-01-28-2020-goals.html">in my blog.</a> That worked out OK, so I’m going to do that again this year.</p>
<h2 id="new-goals">New Goals</h2>
<p>My goals for 2021 are based on my goals from 2020 - mostly just moving around numbers to make them more realistic. 2020 was a weird year and definitely skewed how those goals turned out.</p>
<h3 id="fermentations"><del>12</del> 6 Fermentations</h3>
<p>In 2020 I wanted to ferment 12 things: beer, kombucha, or anything really. It felt really weird going through with that last year without being able to reasonably share anything. This year I plan on doing 6 brews. Hopefully this accounts for enough time to allow vaccinations to become ubiquitous and sharing brews can happen again.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-contributions"><del>12</del> 10 Open Source Contributions</h3>
<p>Last year I aimed for 12 contributions and ended up with 9. This year I just want to push that a little further and get 10 pull requests out.</p>
<h3 id="read-3-2-engineering-books">Read <del>3</del> 2 Engineering Books</h3>
<p>I just didn’t read anything from my engineering reading list last year. This year I’ll shoot for 2 things from that list.</p>
<h3 id="read-6-10-thoughtful-books">Read <del>6</del> 10 Thoughtful Books</h3>
<p>In 2020 I read 7ish nonfiction books for personal growth (you can check them out in the link above), and this year I’d like to push that up to 10 books.</p>
<h2 id="the-checklist">The Checklist</h2>
<p>Just like 2020, in the spirit of accountability I’m going to keep a checklist of my goals on this page.</p>

<h2 id="extras">Extras</h2>
<p>I have a few additional goals that I have not put numbers to for the year. I’d like to keep up with some regular posts like I’ve done in the last 6 months. In 2020 I picked up the guitar again after years of not touching one, and I’d like to maintain a very regular practice schedule. I would also like to get more involved in my local community and activism this coming year as well. I don’t particularly want to put numbers to any of these things - it doesn’t seem likely that putting these in the checklist would create the desired result. These are just a few more things that I think will be important this year and hopefully having these published out here will help me stick to it.</p>
