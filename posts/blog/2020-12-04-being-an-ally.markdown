title: Being an Ally in the Workplace
---

I am privileged to be a white, straight-passing man in the workplace. I've never
had issues having coworkers or managers listen to me or straight up steal credit
for my ideas right in front of me. I have also been very fortunate to have had a
number of women in my life that have impacted me in a significant way, from
family to coworkers and supervisors. This is yet another call and reminder to
privileged colleagues to elavate the voices of our less privileged colleagues -
our teammates, coworkers, even supervisors in some cases, that don't fall into
the "norm" of our workplaces. These can include, but are not limited to,
colleagues with identities other than cis male, colleagues of marginalized
races, colleagues of the LGBQA community, colleagues with disabilities, and
colleagues with beliefs other than the assumed default.\*

## Preface

Let me preface this with another warning that I am not an expert, I'm just a
teammate that would like to be as supportive as possible. If there are any tips
that any readers have that should be included let me know so that I can add
them!

The aim with this post is to highlight ways for us to support each other as
teammates and colleagues and to try to spot the ways we may subtley slight each
other in the workplace. In other words, this is not discussing the overt sexist,
racist, ableist, etc., events that happen in some workplaces. Obviously we need
to stand up for each other when we see these things happening in front of us and
demand corrective action when it happens. We need to believe victims and support
them. We need to share details amongst ourselves regarding those
behind-closed-doors reviews that systemically target our mnarginalized comrades.
But I am even less of an expert in those matters because I have been lucky
enough to work in organizations where I have not personally witnessed or heard
of these situations. This is not to disregard these events but I can't speak to
those as well.

A final word of preface. These are not my own ideas, they have been borrowed
and aggregated from others. In particular, several years ago at a previous
employer we had a presentation for being an ally to women in the workplace, and
the suggestions absolutely generalize to other groups. Unfortunately, I have
forgotten the name of the speaker and cannot cite them directly (don't be like
me, elevate others and don't steal their ideas).

## Being a Supportive Teammate

There are a lot of ways that the privileged among us do not realize we squash
voices outside the norm around us. Let's just dive in and look at some things
we can do to be better.

### Meetings

Here are a few ways to make meetings healthier and more effective.

#### Rotate roles in meetings

It's common for teams to make teammates with identities other than cis male
"minute recorders" or "ticket loggers". When this is the pattern suggest to your
team that you rotate roles in your meetings every meeting, once a week, once
a sprint, or however works for your team. If that doesn't work bite the bullet
and split the role with that teammate, although obviously this is less useful.

This pattern of having a single teammate handle these tasks singles them out
as just a "secretary" of the team, and reduces their role in the team. For
that reason alone we should discourage this behavior. Organizations should in
general discourage this behavior because it also reduces the likelihood that
the "recorder" or "logger" will contribute in other ways to the meeting. They
are silenced by being given extra time consuming and mindless tasks and are not
given the chance to meaningfully contribute as a full fledged team member. This
reduction of their status on the team directly impacts the effectiveness of the
team - surely this person was hired to contribute and not sit silently in
meetings.

#### Elevate voices

Our colleagues outside the norm may unfortunately be accustomed to being spoken
over. Imagine that being a regular occurance at work. Doesn't that sound
miserable and exhausting? When you see this happen make sure to ask them what
they were trying to say before moving on in the meeting. If you have a teammate
that does this frequently try speaking to them directly one-on-one so that they
are aware - some people do not even notice they do this. If that doesn't work
mention to a team lead that it is something that your teammate and team should
work on. This open communication is important, and may be awkward at first, but
constructive criticism is important to better each other as colleagues and
allies.

Worse than being spoken over is when one colleague openly steals credit for an
idea from another in a meeting. When you see this happen make sure to
acknowledge the appropriate teammate publicly so that your team knows that your
teammate is significant and hopefully help that teammate feel valued.

### Team Communiciations

Tools like slack and teams are critical for communication amongst a team,
especially right now. It is easy, however, to incidentally exclude teammates
using these tools. The common way I've seen this is to rely on direct messages
rather than using a team channel for discussing and collaborating on tasks.

The issue with using DMs is that it entirely excludes teammates who otherwise
may have had meaningful contribution to the discussion if they were able to
"overhear" it. It's OK to @ your teammate in your team channel and have a thread
regarding the issue - this is similar to collaborating in a shared team work
space. This at least allows everyone to see that the discussion is ongoing and
if they have additional incite they can easily jump in and add to it.

DMs should be avoided in most cases in general. They exclude teammates, they
conceal work being done and contributors to that work, and they can conceal
actual issues. How often are production issues brought up to a specific person
rather than that team or a more appropriate channel? The time spent
troubleshooting in DMs is better spent troubleshooting in public to bring
awareness of issues. When someone DMs for work related topics try moving the
conversation to the appropriate location.

### Recreation

This one is a bit different than the others. Clearly we're not necessarily
friends with all of our teammates nor do we always share each others interests.
However, it is always positive to expand an invite to a break time activity
or lunch to the rest of your team when a few of you are slipping away from the
desk for a bit. Personally, I love foosball and table tennis. The table size
may be limited but its easy to rotate players between games and invite more
people than can play at once. In general, just try to be inclusive of team mates
even when you don't necessarily speak with them all the time.

## Conclusion

This is far from an exhaustive list of methodologies to being an ally in the
workspace. Hopefully this gets the juices flowing on things you may or may not
have noticed before and things you and your team can do better. We should
always be striving to learning more and doing better by our colleagues.

Again, if there are more ideas to add to this list or things that are incorrect
that should be fixed let me know and I'll include those in this post!

### Footnotes

\* This sentence took me a much longer time to write than expected. I'm always
trying to learn and understand, and I am almost completely certain that I've
missed some marginalized groups that should be highlighted here. If you see
some groups that you feel should be included definitely contact me and I can
update this list! If you feel that I've used incorrect terminology here or
anywhere please let me know so I can remain informed and edit this post
accordingly!
