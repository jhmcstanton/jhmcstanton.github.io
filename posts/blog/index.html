            Finally decided to rebuild my site after a short hiatus. Probably around my sophomore year at KU I decided
to find out how to build a dynamic website and picked up <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and deployed to
<a href="https://www.openshift.com/">openshift</a>. At some point the tier I was dropped and I never bothered to migrate the site
or posts anywhere.

That being said, now I have this site built with Hakyll and will potentially post here occasionally. General blog posts probably won't come up,
but any posted can be found here:
