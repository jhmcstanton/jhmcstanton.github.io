Just wanted to throw out a quick reminder that the annual
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is going on throughout the
month of December. For those unfamiliar with the event, every day up to
and including December 25th two new programming problems are released.
It's a fun way to pass the time, and the [community shares solutions and hints
for problems as they are solved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)

It's about halfway through the event, but it's not too late to get started. 
I myself only got around to looking at the problems today - I probably won't
do the entire advent but it still seems very doable. Happy Hacking!
