title: 2020 Advent of Code
---

Just a reminder that the
[2020 Advent of Code starts today!](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) For
those unfamiliar with the Advent of Code, it's 25 days of coding problems
for the month of December. These are fun little (and sometimes not so little)
brain teasers that start off easy that then ramp up in difficulty as the month
goes on. Definitely recommended if you are having a chill month in the shop and
want a little something extra to sink your teeth into.
