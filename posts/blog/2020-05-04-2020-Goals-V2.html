        <p>My last post <a href="./2020-01-28-2020-goals.html">waaay back in January</a> outlined some lofty goals for the year. The goals were generated from the desire to do some general personal betterment, and the loftiness came partially from 2019 being a year of being on hold for my family due to major health events. Shortly after posting those I decided that some other / better personal goals would involve catching up on other things for mental health‚Äôs sake. I will likely still try to accomplish some of those, and will be leaving those up unedited, but no longer plan on holding myself strictly to completing the list.</p>
<p>Here are some other things I‚Äôve decided to do for the year:</p>
<h2 id="play-the-dark-souls-series">Play the Dark Souls Series</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve played huge chunks of Dark Souls 1 during school, but never finished it (my wife, Melanie, finds it ridiculous how often I started and never finished this). I decided to play through this with some friends this year.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Dark Souls</td>
<td>‚úì</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Dark Souls 2</td>
<td>‚úì</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Dark Souls 3</td>
<td>‚úì</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="general-game-backlog">General Game Backlog</h2>
<p>In the last few years I‚Äôve amassed a huge game backlog. Seems like a good time to catch up on some of this. I‚Äôd really like to get back to playing games socially and couch co-oping some with Melanie.</p>
<h2 id="play-more-boardgames">Play More Boardgames</h2>
<p>There are a ton of games to catch up on, and its been some time since I‚Äôve played many. <a href="https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/">Table Top Simulator</a> is great for doing this remotely with friends.</p>
<h2 id="watch-some-anime">Watch Some Anime</h2>
<p>I haven‚Äôt watch anime for a few seasons, and its time to check out some more.</p>
<h2 id="whatever-else">Whatever Else</h2>
<p>My initial plans for the year were about bettering myself technically, professionally, and civically, and I still plan on doing that. What was missed when planning was just doing some recreational things for myself, and I plan on spending some extra time taking care of myself.</p>
