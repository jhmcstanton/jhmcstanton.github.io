title: First Post!

First post on the new site! As stated elsewhere, as a student I decided to build a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) site to learn the framework (and dynamic websites in general) for myself. At some point the free PaaS tier I was using dropped support and I just haven't had a site for a few years. Finally decided to bring it back.

This site is built with [`Hakyll`](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), as you can see in the footer, and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). `Hakyll` is a Haskell static site generator. The repository is [here](https://github.com/jhmcstanton/jhmcstanton.github.io/) for those that are curious.
