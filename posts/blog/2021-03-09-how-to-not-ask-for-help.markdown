title: "PSA: How to (Not) Ask for Help"
---

Even if many people have been working from home for almost a year sometimes we
can all use a refresher on appropriate ways to request help from others in
asynchronous communications channels. This is broadly applicable to work, event
organizing, volunteer groups, etc.


## DON'T stop at 'Hi' or 'Can you help with something?'

Messaging someone for help but not including what you need help with in the first message
is not respectful of their time. The person receiving the message may be juggling multiple
issues at once, walking their dog, commuting, etc. It's mutually beneficial to get straight
to the point so that your issue can be addressed quickly and they are not waiting around
for the actual question.

## DON'T use direct messages

If multiple people may be able to answer your question use an appropriate
channel for that. Again, this is mutually beneficial. This isn't putting a
specific person on the hook to deal with your issue plus it increases visibility
to the issue you are having.

## DON'T skip documented process

Make sure to use the appropriate channels for interacting with the person or
group. If they specifically request all help requests go through a specific
channel or email group make sure to follow their lead. It's a pain being on
the receiving end of someone asking for things via side channels.

## DON'T leave out context

Context is important. Remember to include both the context you think is
important in the initial help request _and_ the context that is expected from
you when you are asking for help. If you message someone saying "Help, this door
is stuck, please help!" they'll need to know where you are and what door is
stuck.

Likewise, if the person you messaged sends you a series of questions so they can
get up to speed, don't expect help until you fill in all the blanks.

## DON'T cry wolf

Don't be the person who acts like every one of your problems is incredibly
urgent, especially if you can't be bothered filling in context. It may be urgent
to you, but if the person on the other end doesn't even know what's going on
it's not going to be urgent for them, especially if this happens more than once.

## DON'T tell someone to get details in a call

If a problem is not urgent enough to warrant a direct phone call then it is
absolutely not urgent enough to message someone to _just_ tell them to get in a
conference call. If there is already an ongoing conference call that they should
join make sure they can easily access that call but _include context in the
message._ It's easier to get up to speed if the problem has been formally
written than by derailing an ongoing conversation just to ask to catch up. This
helps everyone involved.

## Chat Etiquette

Etiquette and being polite is much more than social niceties. A key element is
being respectful of others _and their time._ Just remember to be kind, polite,
and that every other person on the planet has their own life with their own
busy schedules and you should be fine.
