        <p>We‚Äôre half way through October, so there are still two weeks to participate in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> this year. For those unfamiliar with it, Hacktoberfest encourages people to contribute to open source by offering free t-shirts to the first X thousand people to contribute 4 <em>relevant</em> pull requests.</p>
<p>For those familiar with the event, that new ‚Äú<em>relevant</em>‚Äù criteria was added this year: pull requests need to be to projects that have a ‚Äúhacktoberfest‚Äù topic, or your pull request needs to be manually marked as ‚Äúhacktoberfest-accepted‚Äù by the project owner. This is an effort to reduce spam that has been bad for the last few years, but especially so this year. You can see <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update">details here</a>.</p>
<p>Hacktoberfest is a great way to get started contributing to open source. Find some low hanging fruit that project maintainers may not have the time to knock out: small features, a bug, fleshing out or correcting documentation. There are tons of options out there, and, heck, you might even get a free t-shirt out of it.</p>
