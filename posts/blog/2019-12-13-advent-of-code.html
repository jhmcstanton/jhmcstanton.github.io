<p>Just wanted to throw out a quick reminder that the annual <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is going on throughout the month of December. For those unfamiliar with the event, every day up to and including December 25th two new programming problems are released. It‚Äôs a fun way to pass the time, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">community shares solutions and hints for problems as they are solved.</a></p>
<p>It‚Äôs about halfway through the event, but it‚Äôs not too late to get started. I myself only got around to looking at the problems today - I probably won‚Äôt do the entire advent but it still seems very doable. Happy Hacking!</p>
