title: Skip Meetings
---

A coworker with some seniority and experience once told me that they don't
bother to attend any meeting that is missing an agenda. Their reasoning was that
if the organizer can't be bothered to tell attendees why they need to be there,
then the meeting is almost certainly unnecessary. I've thought about this a fair
amount as a frequent meeting attendee and organizer, and it's really helped to
shape what I view as an acceptable use of _other people's_ time.

## Start Right 

Including an agenda in meeting invitation forces the organizer to make a brief
outline of the meeting and can help guide the meeting. It also allows attendees
to be prepared for the event so that they can contribute or, optionally, decline
it if it is not relevent to them.

As an organizer, if you cannot come up with a succinct list for the event then
consider if the meeting is worth having or if you are the appropriate organizer
for it. When the agenda is made use it to guide who should be invited and how
long the meeting should be. If it's a short agenda or the invite list is
sufficiently small ask yourself the classic question "can this be an email?"
Meetings really should only be utilized for situations that require close
collaboration and synchronous, instant discussion. If the collaboration can be
handled well through email or chat messages try that first. Plus, you have the
added benefit of free meeting minutes this way.

As an attendee, consider rejecting any meeting that is missing an agenda, and
refer to a provided agenda to determine if you need to attend. If able, offer
the organizer feedback when declining the event so they can better organize in
the future.

## Bail Early

We've all been there: sitting in a meeting that has overstayed its welcome or
took a turn that is no longer relevant to yourself. Just an obnoxious position
to be in, and potentially causing someone to work late (or later than they'd
like) because they lost productivity time to another meeting.
A previous manager of mine once let new hires know that if they find themselves
in this situation they should feel comfortable to dip out of the meeting early.
Their opinion was that this time isn't useful for the company and we should be
aware of how we use time while on the clock. I have a similar sentiment - time
spent in a (useless) meeting is time that could be spent being productive and,
in turn, allow us to comfortably leave work on time.

As an organizer, be respectful of your attendee's time. Do not allow meetings to
expand to fill the time allowed - if the agenda is finished then wrap it up.
This is something to especially be aware of during recurring meetings -
sometimes these are going to run a little short. That doesn't mean that we need
to twist some arms to get more participation - it probably just means that the
full time isn't needed this week/sprint/month. Give folks some slack and give
them back a few minutes whenever you can.

## TL;DR

Be conscious and respectful of your time and your colleague's time. Meetings
need a plan, and if they don't have one reject or cancel them. Bail on meetings
that are no longer relevant to yourself and give coworkers time back whenever
able.
