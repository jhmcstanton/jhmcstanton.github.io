title: "Lukewarm Take #6: Saying we \"want a better life for our children\" is messed up"
---

When we say we work hard to give our children a better life than we had we mean
well. But it's missing an important point. We're saying that we had to do things
the hard way and want to give them a leg up so they don't have to work so hard
to live a good life. There's nothing wrong with this - hopefully everyone wants
the best for their kids. However, hidden in plainsight in the statement are a
couple of glaring problems:

- the statement acknowledges that opportunity is not equal across demographics
- the positive sentiment is limited to only "our own" that we are working,
  saving, and struggling for.
  
In other words, we frequently can't see the forest for the trees when we say "we\*
want a better life for our children than we had."

## A similar saying

We have a similar saying that, I would argue, has a much stronger implication
for the future: "We work hard because we want a better _world_ for our children
than we had." This small change embeds much bolder implications, namely, that
broad systemic changes are needed to better the world for not only our _own_
children, but extended family, friends, and others in our community. It embeds
the notion that there is more change needed than just for specific individuals
nearest to us. It highlights that there is more work to do than just buckle down
at our laborspaces to make local economic change for our own family but that we
also have to make significant changes to our current social environment,
economic system, and ecological policies.

Striving _and working_ for a better world will help everyone, including our own.
We should not only be giving our children a leg up in the world but also
minimizing the need for that leg up in the first place. The only people that may
be "negatively impacted" by dismantling unjust systems would be the _extremely_
privileged.



## Check our assumptions

There is nothing wrong with wanting a better life for our children - that's only
natural. We just need to double check our assumptions about _how_ exactly we are
trying to achieve that. We should be organizing together to make the world a
better place for _all_ of our children. Striving for a better world rather than
individual better lives encourages all of us to work collectively to solve these
problems in mutually beneficial ways that will help all future generations.

- \* This is a very broad "we" but this specific sentiment, that this saying has
built-in blinders, is probably most applicable to other folks who live with a
significant amount of social privilege. In other words, I would _assume\*\*_
people with less social privilege are more likely to strive for social changes
when saying that they want a better life for their children.
- \*\* I'm painting with a very broad brush throughout this short post, eh?
