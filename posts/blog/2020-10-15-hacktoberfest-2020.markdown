title: 'Hacktoberfest 2020!'
---

We're half way through October, so there are still two weeks to participate in
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) this year. For those unfamiliar with it,
Hacktoberfest encourages people to contribute to open source by offering free t-shirts to the first
X thousand people to contribute 4 _relevant_ pull requests.

For those familiar with the event, that new "_relevant_" criteria was added this year: pull requests
need to be to projects that have a "hacktoberfest" topic, or your pull request needs to be manually
marked as "hacktoberfest-accepted" by the project owner. This is an effort to reduce spam that has
been bad for the last few years, but especially so this year. You can see
[details here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update).

Hacktoberfest is a great way to get started contributing to open source. Find some low hanging
fruit that project maintainers may not have the time to knock out: small features, a bug, fleshing out
or correcting documentation. There are tons of options out there, and, heck, you might even get a free
t-shirt out of it.
