            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi! As you can see above, my name is Jim McStanton. I’m a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.cerner.com/">Cerner</a> where I work in the Big Data space of the Population Health organization. The teams I’ve been on build tools to ingest and transform large amounts of data and REST services that allow teams and clients to inspect their ingested data.</p>
<p>My academic background is Computer Engineering at the University of Kansas. There I became interested in processor architecture, functional programming, and embedded systems. In addition to my course work I also worked in the <a href="http://ku-fpg.github.io/">KU functional programming group</a> under Dr. Andy Gill.</p>
<p>In addition to functional programming, software, and computer engineering, I also like to spend time with my dogs, baking, brewing beer, and playing PC games.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to contact me, or for my resume, head over to <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a></p>
