For our first anniversary (2017) my wife surprised me with a lesson in how to brew my own beer at the Overland Park <a href="http://www.brewlabkc.com/">Brew Lab</a>. I was immediately
smitten with brewing, and she surprised me yet again with a home bew kit of my own and <a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/">John Palmer's How to Brew</a>.

Here you can find any brews I post!
