title: About
---
Hi! As you can see above, my name is Jim McStanton. I'm a Software Engineer
at `Cerner <https://www.cerner.com/>`_ where I work in the Big Data space of the
Population Health organization. The teams I've been on build tools to ingest
and transform large amounts of data and REST services that allow teams and
clients to inspect their ingested data.

My academic background is Computer Engineering at the University of Kansas. There
I became interested in processor architecture, functional programming, and
embedded systems. In addition to my course work I also worked in the `KU
functional programming group <http://ku-fpg.github.io/>`_ under Dr. Andy Gill. 

In addition to functional programming, software, and computer engineering, I also
like to spend time with my dogs, baking, brewing beer, and playing PC games. 

If you're looking for a way to contact me, or for my resume, head over to `Contact <./contact.html>`_
